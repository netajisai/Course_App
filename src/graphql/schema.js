// The ! means the field is non-nullable --> GraphQL enforces it before hitting your resolver
// so if we leave any field, that is defined in schema the query itself is rejected with a GraphQL validation error



// Auth handling
// REST --> req.tokenId set by middleware(JWT)
// GraphQL --> taking adminId as an argument
// less secure(a user could fake any adminId)
// extract adminId from GraphQL context(where JWT is decoded)
